#### Method Binding Utilities

- **React-Autobind**  
  https://github.com/cassiozen/React-autobind  
  A useful utility to bind class methods.  A good compromise - makes binding explicit, but removes repetition.

  https://github.com/zackargyle/react-bind-decorator  
  Another autobinding approach, intended to be fast and performant.
  
- **react-class-binder**  
  https://github.com/Klathmon/react-class-binder  
  https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/4p0ytu/i_made_a_small_package_to_easily_autobind_this_in/  
  Automatically bind methods defined in a React component using the ES2015 class syntax (similar to how React.createClass works).  The Reddit comments have discussion on some differences between the various libs that implement autobinding.
